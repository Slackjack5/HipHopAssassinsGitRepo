    message: Well done, team.
  - name: Vanguard
    message: You all may have noticed that you have Macros at your disposal.
  - name: Vanguard
    message: We may encounter bugs that are resistant to our normal Attacks.
  - name: Vanguard
    message: In that case, Analysis and I can cast Macros that strengthen the power
      of our Attacks.
  - name: Vanguard
    message: Alternatively, you, Initiate, have Macros that deal Macro damage, which
      bypasses any physical resistance.
  - name: Vanguard
    message: Macros cost a certain amount of AP to cast, so use them wisely.
  - name: Analysis
    message: My Macros are supportive in nature.
  - name: Analysis
    message: Buffs affect all of us, and the same buff can be stacked up to two times.
  - name: Analysis
    message: Initiate, you've got the big guns. I say we practice on that cube over
      there.
  - name: Analysis
    message: From my analysis, that one looks to be resistant to our normal Attacks.
  - name: Analysis
    message: I recommend casting Debug to quickly eliminate it, Initiate.
  - name: Initiate
    message: Copy that.
